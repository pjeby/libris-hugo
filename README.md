# Libris Hugo

A port of the [Stackbit Libris](https://github.com/stackbithq/stackbit-theme-libris) theme for use with Hugo.  [Live Demo](https://pjeby.github.io/libris-hugo/)

Note: I am still refactoring things to be more Hugo-friendly, so things may change a lot.  If you update your local copy of this theme to a new version, *you should expect things to break*.  The theme is currently quite functional (even more so than the original in some aspects), but I expect to still be refactoring various things in the future, like:

* improved page components system and DRY rendering thereof
* archetypes
* better separation between the theme and the example site (some site stuff may still be in the theme)

And any or all of these changes might be backward-incompatible with the effective "API" of a previous release.

## Creating Documentation Areas or "Books"

A site can have one or more "books" of documentation, each with its own customized navigation pane.  To create such an area, add the following front matter field to the `_index.md` of a `contents` subdirectory you want to make into such an area (e.g. `contents/docs/`):

```yaml
---
cascade:
  # Default to the 'book' content type for everything under this directory
  type: book

  # Path to the top-level page or section to be displayed on the nav pane; if omitted,
  # it defaults to this area's top-level section (e.g. /docs, /guide, /tutorial etc.)
  book: /docs

  # Paths to the pages or sections to be displayed as chapters in the nav pane
  # Paths are interpreted relative to 'book'; you can use absolute paths to bring
  # in sections or pages from elsewhere in the site.
  chapters:
    - getting-started
    - guides
    - faq
---
```

Once this is done, any pages or subsections created under the directory where this file is located will automatically use the `book` type's page layout and have a navigation pane with the listed entries.  Each `chapters` item can be a page or section; if it's a section, its immediate child pages will be listed in the nav pane as a collasped submenu, ordered by weight.  You can also add something like this to chapters whose submenus you want to customize:

```yaml
---
# Adding 'chapter-contents' to a page or section listed in 'chapters' lets you set what pages
# will be listed as child items in the nav bar; if you don't set it, all child pages
# are listed, ordered by weight.  Relative paths are looked up relative to this page
chapter-contents:
  - first-page
  - second-page
---
```

This is usually a lot easier than fiddling with weights across multiple files, especially in a large project: just go to the "parent" page and add a `chapter-contents` list.  (You can also do this to add literally any pages you like to the menu.)

Documentation books can also include an overview page using the `overview` layout: these don't have a navbar, but instead display the current book's chapters as article-preview cards, using their explicit `summary` fields or summaries autogenerated by Hugo.  (All pages or sections referenced by `chapters` and `chapter-contents` must also have a `title` in order to be displayed properly on the navbar or on overview pages.)

(Notice, by the way, that a page does not need to be *inside* a book to use the overview layout: it just requires the page be of type `book`, and that it have a `chapters` property set on the page or cascaded from a parent.  Likewise, pages or sections listed in `chapters` or `chapter-contents` do not have to be of type `book`, and can be any page or section of the site: they just won't have the same nav pane, or perhaps any nav pane at all.)

### Example

Here is an example folder structure for a single documentation area, `/welcome`:

```
.
├── content
│   ├── welcome
│   │   ├── _index.md            [documentation root page, "Welcome To Libris"]
│   │   ├── getting-started
│   │   │   ├── _index.md        [section parent page]
│   │   │   ├── installation.md  [section child page]
│   │   │   └── quick-start.md   [section child page]
│   │   ├── guides
│   │   │   ├── _index.md        [section parent page]
│   │   │   ├── features.md      [section child page]
│   │   │   └── overview.md      [section child page]
│   │   └── faq
│   │   │   └── _index.md        [section parent page]
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

`content/welcome/_index.md`:

```yaml
---
title "Welcome To Libris"

cascade:
  layout: docs
  book: /welcome
  chapters:
    - getting-started
    - guides
    - faq
---
```

`content/docs/guides/_index.md`:

```yaml
---
title: Guides
chapter-contents: [ overview, features ]   # explicit order for sub-pages
---
```

### Callouts

To add a callout to your documentation, simply use the following html markup:

```html
<div class="important">
  <strong>Important:</strong> 
  This is the "Important" callout block of text. It indicates a warning or caution.
  Use it for an important message. 
</div>
```

```html
<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> 
  This is the "Note" callout block of text. It signifies a general note.
</div>
```

### Syntax Highlighting

To enable syntax highlighting in your code blocks, add a language identifier. For example, to syntax highlight JavaScript code, specify `javascript` next to the tick marks before the fenced code block:

~~~md
```javascript
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```
~~~

The theme's highlighting uses Prism.js, with a plugin to provide a "Copy" button people can use to copy code samples.

**Important:** you must disable Hugo's built-in syntax highlighting for this theme's highlighting to work properly.  Use:

```yaml
markup:
  highlight:
    codeFences: false
```

in your config to keep Hugo from doing its own syntax highlighting.

You can add support for more languages or add other Prism plugins using the [Prism Download Tool](https://prismjs.com/download.html#themes=prism&languages=markup+css+clike+javascript&plugins=toolbar+copy-to-clipboard).  Save the generated Javascript as `static/assets/js/prism.js` under your project's main folder, and the theme CSS as `assets/sass/imports/_prism.scss`.  Your site will then use these files in place of the theme defaults.

## Editing the Homepage

The homepage content uses `content/_index.md`. You can edit all of the homepage sections by editing this file's front matter.

## Main Navigation

The items of the main menu located at the top can be defined either inside the page front matter or inside the `config.yml` file.

To add a page menu item, you should define the `menu` parametter in the front matter of the page. For instance:

```yaml
---
title: Welcome to Libris
menu:
  main:
    weight: 2
    name: Docs
---
```

To add a global menu item, you should define it inside the root `menu` field inside `config.yml`. For instance:

```yaml
menu:
  main:
    - identifier: github
      name: GitHub
      url: "https://github.com/"
      weight: 6
```

## Layouts and Content Types

Currently this theme has three content types: `book` (for documentation) and `blog` (for blog sections and posts), and `_default` (for everything else).  They have layouts as follows:

#### Default Content Type

* `single` -- Automatically used for pages without any specified type or layout
* `home` -- Automatically used for the home page, and available to be used by custom landing pages.  Pages using this layout must have a `blocks` parameter in front matter specifying the different sections to be included.  Block types include:
  * `hero` - display a title block with optional subtitle and call-to-action buttons
  * `cards` -- display a grid of cards with titles, summaries, and/or images
  * `content` -- display title, text, CTA buttons, and optional image, as one or two columns
  * `cta` - full-width, dark-background call to action with text and buttons
* `showcase` -- like `home`, except that a default header is used, followed by a `cards` block whose properties are derived from the page.  Additional blocks can be specified in `blocks`, that will appear after the cards block.  This makes it easy to create testimonial pages, customer sites, etc.

#### Book Content Type

* `single`, `list` -- Automatically used for pages and sections of `type: book`, this layout displays a left-side navigation menu from the book's chapters, and a right-side table of contents for the current page
* `overview` -- Pages using this layout will display an overview of the book as grid of cards, one for each chapter, with the chapter's title and summary

#### Blog Content Type

* `single` -- Automatically used for posts of `type: blog`; displays next/previous navigation and a hero image from the `image` front-matter, if present.  If a `thumbnail` property is set, that image will be used in the blog's home page listing.
* `list` -- Automatically used for sections of `type: blog`; displays a reverse-chronological list of pages in that section, paginated with Hugo pagination.  Posts are shown with a thumbnail (if set), title, and summary.

## Social Links

To display social icons in the footer, update the `social.json` file located in the `data` folder. You can use any icon supported by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands) and just need to specify the appropriate Font Awesome class name as the `icon` value.

## Color palettes

Libris supports the following color palettes:

- blue (default)
- green
- navy
- violet

To change the color palette, update the `palette` variable in config.yaml, or set it on individual pages (or parts of your site with `cascade:`).
